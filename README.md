# SciFy
_I need to get some sleep_

SciFy was made when I (Chickenmanfy) thought it would be fun to learn how to make mods in Quilt. It has since been moved to Fabric though, since the community wanted that.

I then remembered when one of my friends (BearCat865) suggested making a Dungeonfy mod, and here we are.

## The Future of SciFy
SciFy was originally born from a "why not?" question in relation to my favourite Minecraft server, Dungeonfy. ("If Skyblock can have client mods, why can't Dungeonfy?") After release, it saw little usage as it had a bunch of annoying bugs that meant it wasn't particularly helpful to anyone. Before I could iron out these kinks, Dungeonfy got shut down. Now I have a useless mod. What do I do with it? Well, my plans are as follows: **make a general purpose Minecraft RPG mod.** We'll see how this goes, but I'd like a mod that can add helpful features on Hypixel Skyblock and Wynncraft, as well as any others you can think of.
