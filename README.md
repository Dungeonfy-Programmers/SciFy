# SciFy
_I need to get some sleep_

SciFy was made when I (Chickenmanfy) thought it would be fun to learn how to make mods in Quilt. It has since been moved to Fabric though, since the community wanted that.

I then remembered when one of my friends (BearCat865) suggested making a Dungeonfy mod, and here we are.
